Oysters and blue crabs often live in the same areas. Blue crabs are predators that can crush and eat oysters. The line plots show the masses of shells of oysters in a coastal area. The top plot shows shell masses of randomly sampled oysters in the area before blue crabs were present. The bottom plot shows shell masses of randomly sampled oysters after ten years of blue crabs in the area.


The mean, median, and mode for both sets of data are given in the table.

Before Blue Crabs After Blue Crabs
Mean 1.8 2.0
Median 1.8 2.0
Mode 1.8 1.8

Compare the measures of center for the two populations. Do the measures of center indicate a difference between the two populations? Explain your answer. What other statistic could be helpful in evaluating whether the oyster population changed over the last ten years? Explain your choice.
Scoring Rubric

Sample responses include:
Both the mean and median increased from 1.8 to 2.0, indicating that shell mass in the oyster population may have increased over the ten years. The mode of both populations is 1.8. The fact that this statistic is the same does not indicate that oyster shell mass changed over ten years. A measure of variability (range, interquartile range, MAD, etc.) would be useful for determining change. The variability appears to have increased in the presence of blue crabs. There appear to be many more oysters with shell masses higher than the mean, median, or mode after the blue crabs were introduced.

The mean and median values increased from 1.8 to 2.0. The mode of both groups is 1.8. Because the sample size is small and the differences in mean and median are small, more information is needed to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups of oysters. A measure of spread like the mean absolute deviation is needed to determine whether there are differences.",7878129,i-341772,efgbnhjhmngbfvdewsq,efgbnhjhmngbfvdewsq,4,2.5,QA QC,Certica Solutions,"4 Points
The response indicates advanced proficiency in using measures of center and variability to informally compare random samples from two populations. The response includes a correct comparison of the means, medians, and modes of the two populations. It discusses whether the measures of center indicate a difference in the sizes of the two populations of oysters using appropriate statistical reasoning. It also indicates that a measure of variability would be helpful in evaluating whether the oyster population changed.

The response indicates proficiency in using measures of center and variability to informally compare random samples from two populations. The response includes about 75% of the elements of a full-credit answer. It may include a correct comparison of the measures of center and a discussion of whether they indicate a difference between the populations, but there is not an indication that a measure of variability is needed to determine if there is a difference in sizes between populations. Or it may include answers to all parts of the question, but there are either errors in comparison or the differences between means and medians are used as proof that there are differences between populations.

2 Points
The response indicates partial proficiency in using measures of center and variability to informally compare random samples from two populations. The response includes about 50% of the elements of a full-credit answer. It may only include comparisons of the three measures of center without a discussion of what conclusions are supported by the comparison or any mention of the need to compare a measure of variability with the two populations.

1 Point

Resting heart rate is the number of times a person’s heart beats during one minute when the person is at rest. Resting heart rate is normally measured first thing in the morning, while the person is still lying down. Resting heart rate can change over time. It can decrease if a person begins an exercise program. It can increase if a person becomes less fit. The table shows resting heart rates in a sample of adult male non-athletes compared with a sample of adult male marathon runners.

1. Resting heart rate is measured in another sample of seven adult male non-athletes. Is the mean resting heart rate in that group likely to be closer to 68 bpm or 58 bpm? Support your answer using the data in the table.

2. More samples of male non-athletes are compared to male athletes in an expanded study of resting heart rate. In which of these groups would there likely be the least variation in resting heart rates among individuals? Support your answer using the data in the table.

3. The resting heart rate of a male who is not part of the study is 55 bpm. Is this male most likely to be an athlete or non-athlete? Support your answer using the data in the table.

4. What kind of difference would be expected when comparing the resting heart rate of female athletes vs. female non-athletes?

Sample Response:
1. It is likely to be closer to 68 bpm, because that is closer to the average resting heart rate of the sample of non-athletes in the table. From the data in the table, the mean resting heart rate of non-athletes is 70.3 and that of athletes is 55.6.
2. There would be the least variation among individuals in the male athletes group, based on data in the table. The range of values for the athletes is 11, while for non-athletes the range is 21.
3. The male is most likely to be an athlete. His resting heart rate is close to the mean in the athlete group, and the range of heart rates does not go as low as 55 in the non-athlete group.
4. One would expect mean resting heart rate to be lower in female athletes vs. female non-athletes. The mean resting heart rate of male athletes vs. male non-athletes is lower, and the same should be true for females.

4 Points
The response indicates advanced proficiency in analyzing data from random samples to draw and support conclusions. The response includes a correct resting heart rate with an explanation. The response also identifies the group that would have the least variation in resting heart rate, along with an explanation. The response also correctly indicates that a male with a heart rate of 55 bpm is likely to be an athlete and explains why. Lastly, the response explains the difference that would be expected when comparing the resting heart rate of female athletes to the resting heart rate of male athletes, with an explanation to support the reasoning.

"Read the passage and answer the following question(s).Learning About the Planets1&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;For thousands of years, people have looked at the stars at night. Long ago they noticed that a few dots of light moved differently in the sky. They called these dots of lights planets. The word planet comes from the Greek for &amp;#8220;wander,&amp;#8221; or move about. They gave the planets names such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.2&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Astronomers looked at the paths the planets followed in the sky. They figured out that the planets travel around the sun. Earth travels around the sun, too. Earth is another planet.Tools3&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;About 400 years ago, the astronomer Galileo used a telescope to look at the sky. &amp;#160;The telescope made things look bigger and clearer. Galileo saw that the planet Jupiter had moons. Later scientists had stronger telescopes. They discovered more planets in the solar system.4&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Modern astronomers use new tools to learn more about the planets. They send spacecraft to visit the planets. The first flight near Venus was in 1962; Mars, in 1965; and Jupiter, in 1973. Those first flights gave scientists a preview of what they might find on these planets later.5&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;The spacecraft carry cameras to take pictures. Some fly around a planet. Others land on the surface. Rovers can move around on the surface. Rovers on Mars explore different parts of the planet.Venus6&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Venus is the planet closest to Earth. It shines brightly just after sunset or just before sunrise. For this reason, it is sometimes called the evening star or the morning star.7&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Venus is a little smaller than Earth and is closer to the sun. It is the hottest planet in the solar system. Nothing could live on Venus because it is so hot.Mars8&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Mars is called &amp;#8220;the red planet&amp;#8221; because it looks red in the sky. It is like Earth in many ways. It has rocks and dirt, mountains and valleys. Two moons circle around it the way our moon circles around Earth.9&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Mars is much colder than Earth. Scientists think it may have been warmer long ago. Perhaps it had water then. Today it mostly has ice.Jupiter10&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Jupiter is the largest of the planets. It is so big that Earth could fit inside it 1,000 times. It has more than 50 moons!11&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;Jupiter is made mostly of gas. It spins very quickly, making strong storms. One area of storms is called the Great Red Spot. An astronomer first saw the Great Red Spot through a telescope more than 300 years ago.Tell four ways that people have studied the planets over the years.",8562580,719def36-e784-48d3-b555-97188016f13b,<p>.A long time ago they noticed that a few dots of light moved differently in the sky.</p><p>About 400 years ago the astronomer galileo used a telescope to look at the sky.</p><p>The first first flight near venus was in 1962 .</p><p>The spacecraft carry cameras to take pictures.</p>,"Four ways that people have studied the planets over the years are ""About 400 years ago, the astronomer Galileo used a telescope to look at the sky"", ""Modern astronomers send spacecraft to visit the planets"", ""Astronomers looked at the paths the planets followed in the sky"", and ""Rovers can move around on the surface.
